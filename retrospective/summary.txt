Merge Conflict Summary:
While working to merge the Test and Working branches within my repository, I encountered an issue with the README.md file due to the changes made that created a conflict. Once this issue was identified, I reviewed both branches and the information associated with them to confirm that the necessary information was up to date and updated any information such as version documentation. I utilized the tools and the proper commands within the terminal window and GitLab and was able to successfully resolve the conflicts; and merged the branches, which helped unify the README.md file, which is also reflected in the screenshot of the repository graph.
